# deadfish

## About
- Deadfish is a very odd interpreted programming language created by Jonathan Todd Skinner. It was released under public domain and was originally programmed in C, but has since been ported to many other programming languages (see below).
- Deadfish has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It only has a few commands, only four in total. It is also case-sensitive, and can deal only with integer values when adding or subtracting, however once squared this number increases greatly!

## Syntax
```
Increment i
Decrement d
Square s
Output o
```
- The interpreter sets the value to zero if and only if ```value == -1 or value == 256```


## Example
- Print 288: ```diissisdo```
- Print Hello World (ASCII values, as numbers):
```
iisiiiisiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiioiiiiiiiooiiio
dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddo
dddddddddddddddddddddsddoddddddddoiiioddddddoddddddddo
```
